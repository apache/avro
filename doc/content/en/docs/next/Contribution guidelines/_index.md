### Github Mirror for Easy Contributing

Avro is mirrored on github so you can contribute with ease:

1. Fork Avro
1. Implement your feature or fix the bug, and
1. Send a pull request.

The Github/Apache integration will send the pull request to our developer list, and we will look at your pull request as soon as we can.

### Fork Avro to your Account

So you have an account registered at Github and are ready to start hacking at Avro. First you need to fork the code to your own Github account.

You can find the official mirror for the Apache Avro project at the following location in the official Apache Software Foundation organisation at Github:

    Apache Avro Github mirror: https://github.com/apache/avro

On this page you will find a button with the label _“Fork”_. Click it or use the button below.

<button><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> [Fork Avro on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/avro/fork)</button>

Now you have your own copy of Avro to hack on. You can edit directly in the Github web interface–good for minor fixes like documentation errors or clone the project to your workstation.

### Clone Avro to your Workstation

You can use the tooling for Github to get a copy on your workstation or use the commandline:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:<your userid>/Avro.git
```
NB Ensure that you replace `<your userid>` with your actual Github user id, otherwise your clone command will fail.

This shell command will create a local checkout of the git repository.

When you are ready with your change you can ask us to review your changes and to integrate it into Avro by creating a Pull Request.

### Create a Pull Request

Make sure you have pushed your changes to your Github repository. To create a pull request on GitHub follow the instructions you can find [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

The Github–Apache integration will automatically send a message to the Avro project that a new pull request is waiting for us.

#### Testing

All pull requests automatically trigger various tests at [Github Actions](https://github.com/apache/avro/actions) on Linux x86_64 and at [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/apache/avro) on Linux ARM64.
