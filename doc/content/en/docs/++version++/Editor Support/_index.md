## Overview

When editing an Avro schema, everyone has a preferred editor. Some use an IDE, like IntelliJ, PyCharm, RustRover or
Visual Studio, while others prefer a more humble text editor like Atom/Pulsar, Emacs or Vim.

Most provide help when working with Avro via JSON support (for JSON schemata) by offering syntax highlighting and
formatting. Some provide more help, for example syntax highlighting for IDL schemata, code completion, error
highlighting and more.

The IDEs and editors that we know to support Avro better than just editing schemata as JSON files are listed below in
alphabetical order.

## Eclipse
