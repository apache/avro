The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited Oscar
Westra van Holthe - Kind to become a committer and we are pleased to announce that
he has accepted.

Oscar has done some really solid work on the IDL and JavaCC parts of the Java
SDK.  We trust his work and think it's exceptionally high quality.  From the 
start, he has already doing much of the work of a committer, demonstrated by
his continuous presence in commenting JIRA, reviewing PRs as well as 
encouraging and insightful words on the mailing list.

As a bonus, in his spare time, Oscar also maintains the IntelliJ plugin for
[IDL support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15728-apache-avro-idl-schema-support)!

Thanks for all your hard work, and welcome!
