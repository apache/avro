The Apache Avro project has a new project logo!

The old logo was derived from the logo of a (now defunct) aircraft manufacturer
in Great Britain. This posed a risk, as the Apache foundation would not contest
legal action (even if extremely unlikely).

But thanks to Emma Kellam, we now have a new logo! She has made several logo
designs, and after some debate and several votes (it was a close call!), we can
announce the new logo:

[//]: # (the logo scales to 100% high or all available width, so limit it)
<p style="height: 10rem">
{{< project_logo >}}
</p>

The new logo is an homage to the previous logo, which is also triangular and
uses blue colours. The paper airplane embodies keywords like 'fast', 'small'
and 'efficient'. The blobby tail left behind by the airplane makes the icon
unique and embodies 'flow' and 'transformation'.

All in all a very nice logo for Apache Avro, which embodies the same keywords.

Thanks for all your hard work Emma, and welcome!
