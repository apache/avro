The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro
has invited David Mollitor to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.

Since 2017, David has raised and fixed many issues in the
Java SDK.  Recently he's been finding and providing fixes for subtle
performance issues.  His work is always high-quality and he is
reactive and pleasant to talk with on code reviews and JIRA.

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.

It's great to have you as part of the team, David!
