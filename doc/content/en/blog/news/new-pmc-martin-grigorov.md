The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro is pleased to announce that Martin Grigorov has accepted our invitation to become a PMC member.  He has has been active, reliable and responsive to the community and a solid contributor to various SDKs, bringing well-thought out reviews and comments to both old and new PRs and JIRA.  He definitely stepped up for the website refactoring and preparing for the 1.11.1 release!

Please join me in welcoming Martin to the Avro PMC!
