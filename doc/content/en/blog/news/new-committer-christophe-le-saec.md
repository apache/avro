The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited Christophe
Le Saec to become a committer and we are pleased to announce that
he has accepted.

Christophe definitely puts in the work and, has an impressive breadth of 
knowledge about the languages of the Avro SDK!

As an ASF project, we tend to be very conservative about making changes, and
Christophe brings in fresh ideas and very quickly proposes concrete 
implementations to prove them.  He has a good understanding of Avro, the
motivation to move things forward, and the expertise to make changes!  At the
same time, he's easy to talk to and flexible in coming to a consensus.

Thanks for all your hard work!
