The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited Michael A.
Smith to the PMC and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Notably, Michael has taken a leadership role in ensuring the quality of the
Python SDK, lending his expertise to ensure that Avro has a place in the 
python community, while keeping our implementation up-to-date with standards
and modern versions.  It's not an easy task, and we appreciate all he does!
