## Quick start

Looking to quickly add Bootstrap to your project? Use jsDelivr, a free open source CDN. Using a package manager or need to download the source files? [Head to the downloads page]({{< docsref "/getting-started/download" >}}).

### CSS

Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{< param "cdn.css" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.css_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### JS

Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Popper](https://popper.js.org/), and our own JavaScript plugins. We use [jQuery's slim build](https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/), but the full version is also supported.

Place **one of the following `<script>`s** near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper, and then our JavaScript plugins.

#### Bundle

Include every Bootstrap JavaScript plugin with one of our two bundles. Both `bootstrap.bundle.js` and `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) for our tooltips and popovers, but not [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Include jQuery first, then a Bootstrap JavaScript bundle. For more information about what's included in Bootstrap, please see our [contents]({{< docsref "/getting-started/contents#precompiled-bootstrap" >}}) section.

```html
<script src="{{< param "cdn.jquery" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.jquery_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{< param "cdn.js_bundle" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.js_bundle_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### Separate

If you decide to go with the separate scripts solution, Popper must come first (if you're using tooltips or popovers), and then our JavaScript plugins.

```html
<script src="{{< param "cdn.jquery" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.jquery_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{< param "cdn.popper" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.popper_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{< param "cdn.js" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.js_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### Components

Curious which components explicitly require jQuery, our JavaScript, and Popper? Click the show components link below. If you're unsure about the page structure, keep reading for an example page template.

<details>
<summary class="text-primary mb-3">Show components requiring JavaScript</summary>
{{< markdown >}}
- Alerts for dismissing
- Buttons for toggling states and checkbox/radio functionality
- Carousel for all slide behaviors, controls, and indicators
- Collapse for toggling visibility of content
- Dropdowns for displaying and positioning (also requires [Popper](https://popper.js.org/))
- Modals for displaying, positioning, and scroll behavior
- Navbar for extending our Collapse plugin to implement responsive behavior
- Tooltips and popovers for displaying and positioning (also requires [Popper](https://popper.js.org/))
- Scrollspy for scroll behavior and navigation updates

## Starter template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{< param "cdn.css" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.css_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- Optional JavaScript; choose one of the two! -->

    <!-- Option 1: jQuery and Bootstrap Bundle (includes Popper) -->
    <script src="{{< param "cdn.jquery" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.jquery_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="{{< param "cdn.js_bundle" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.js_bundle_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    <!-- Option 2: Separate Popper and Bootstrap JS -->
    <!--
    <script src="{{< param "cdn.jquery" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.jquery_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="{{< param "cdn.popper" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.popper_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="{{< param "cdn.js" >}}" integrity="{{< param "cdn.js_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    -->
  </body>
</html>
```

That's all you need for overall page requirements. Visit the [Layout docs]({{< docsref "/layout/overview" >}}) or [our official examples]({{< docsref "/examples" >}}) to start laying out your site's content and components.

## Important globals

Bootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you'll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the *normalization* of cross browser styles. Let's dive in.

### HTML5 doctype

Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you'll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn't cause any considerable hiccups.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

### Responsive meta tag

Bootstrap is developed *mobile first*, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, **add the responsive viewport meta tag** to your `<head>`.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```

You can see an example of this in action in the [starter template](#starter-template).

### Box-sizing

For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global `box-sizing` value from `content-box` to `border-box`. This ensures `padding` does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:

```css
.selector-for-some-widget {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
```

With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via `::before` and `::after`—will all inherit the specified `box-sizing` for that `.selector-for-some-widget`.

Learn more about [box model and sizing at CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/).

### Reboot

For improved cross-browser rendering, we use [Reboot]({{< docsref "/content/reboot" >}}) to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.

## CSPs and embedded SVGs

Several Bootstrap components include embedded SVGs in our CSS to style components consistently and easily across browsers and devices. **For organizations with more strict <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr> configurations**, we've documented all instances of our embedded SVGs (all of which are applied via `background-image`) so you can more thoroughly review your options.

- [Close button]({{< docsref "/utilities/close-icon" >}}) (used in alerts and modals)
- [Custom checkboxes and radio buttons]({{< docsref "/components/forms#custom-forms" >}})
- [Form switches]({{< docsref "/components/forms#switches" >}})
- [Form validation icons]({{< docsref "/components/forms#validation" >}})
- [Custom select menus]({{< docsref "/components/forms#select-menu" >}})
- [Carousel controls]({{< docsref "/components/carousel#with-controls" >}})
- [Navbar toggle buttons]({{< docsref "/components/navbar#responsive-behaviors" >}})

Based on [community conversation](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25394), some options for addressing this in your own codebase include replacing the URLs with locally hosted assets, removing the images and using inline images (not possible in all components), and modifying your CSP. Our recommendation is to carefully review your own security policies and decide on a best path forward, if necessary.
