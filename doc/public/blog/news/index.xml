&lt;p&gt;The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited
Zoltan Csizmadia to become a committer and we are pleased to announce
that he has accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoltan has been present in the C# SDK for over two years and has
really increased his activity in maintaining this language in the last
few months.  He knows the technology, but more importantly, he is
patient and works well with those of us who rely on the expertise of
others.  Recently, he has been engaging with other contributors to
increase the maintainability and quality of the dotnet code, and we
have confidence in his decisions to balance stability of the
established code and the expectations of modern C# developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a committer enables easier contribution to the project since
there is no need to go via the patch submission process. This should
enable better productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join me in congratulating Zoltan on his recognition of great
work thus far in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
