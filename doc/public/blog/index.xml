&lt;p&gt;The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited
Zoltan Csizmadia to become a committer and we are pleased to announce
that he has accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoltan has been present in the C# SDK for over two years and has
really increased his activity in maintaining this language in the last
few months.  He knows the technology, but more importantly, he is
patient and works well with those of us who rely on the expertise of
others.  Recently, he has been engaging with other contributors to
increase the maintainability and quality of the dotnet code, and we
have confidence in his decisions to balance stability of the
established code and the expectations of modern C# developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a committer enables easier contribution to the project since
there is no need to go via the patch submission process. This should
enable better productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join me in congratulating Zoltan on his recognition of great
work thus far in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro
has invited Martin Grigorov to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, he has been active, reliable and easy to
work with on PRs and on the mailing list.  His work is of high
quality, and he has a breadth of experience in many of the SDK languages.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially keen to point out the work he&amp;rsquo;s been doing on the website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you as part of the team, Martin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Java: AVRO-2863 Support Avro core on android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript: AVRO-3131 Drop support for node.js 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl: AVRO-3190 Fix error when reading from EOF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python: AVRO-2906 Improved performance validating deep record data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python: AVRO-2914 Drop Python 2 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python: AVRO-3004 Drop Python 3.5 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby: AVRO-3108 Drop Ruby 2.5 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the 1.11.0 release includes experimental support for
&lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;. Work is continuing on this donated SDK, but we have not versioned and
published official artifacts for this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;: The avro package fully supports Python 3. We will no longer publish a
separate avro-python3 package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course upgraded dependencies to latest versions, CVE fixes and more:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%3DAVRO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D1.11.0&#34;&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%3DAVRO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D1.11.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro
has invited David Mollitor to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, David has raised and fixed many issues in the
Java SDK.  Recently he&amp;rsquo;s been finding and providing fixes for subtle
performance issues.  His work is always high-quality and he is
reactive and pleasant to talk with on code reviews and JIRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you as part of the team, David!&lt;/p&gt;
