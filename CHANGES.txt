Avro 1.2.0 (14 October 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-115. Remove RPC's session notion to facilliate the use of
    stateless transports like UDP and HTTP.  Add a UDP transport.
    (cutting)

    AVRO-120. Improved package and namespace handling, including:

     * Removed explicit package-name specification from specific and
       reflect public APIs.  Package names are now determined either
       by namespace declarations or by a Java classes, as appropriate.

     * Changed the specific compiler to generate separate java files
       per class, rather than nested classes.  This permits generated
       classes to be in packages declared in their schema namespaces.

     * Fix namespace defaulting.  The default namespace is declared in
       the outermost schema or protocol.  Nested schemas can now
       declare different namespaces than the default.

     * Names may now be specified with a dotted notation, e.g.,
       "foo.bar.Baz", to indicate the name "Baz" in namespace
       "foo.bar".  This permits one to refer to schemas in a namespace
       other than the default.

  NEW FEATURES

    AVRO-121.  Permit reflect and specific datum readers to read data
    written with a different version of the schema than is current.
    (cutting)

    AVRO-129.  Add HTTP-based RPC client and server.  (cutting)

    (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    AVRO-119.  Add Java GenericData.Array#toString() implementation,
    to facillitate debugging. (cutting)

    AVRO-118.  JSON encoder and decoder now permit one to write
    multiple instances without flushing or explicitly resetting the
    codec between each instance.  (Thiruvalluvan M. G. via cutting)

    AVRO-133.  Update version number in specification document and
    documentation tab automatically from build version. (cutting)

    AVRO-131.  Permit specification of JUnit test output format.
    (Giridharan Kesavan via cutting)

    AVRO-134.  Update data file format specification to include
    reserved metadata keys "codec" and "sync".  The only codec
    currently defined is "null".  (Thiruvalluvan M. G. via cutting)

    without running checkstyle or javadoc.  (Thiruvalluvan M. G. via

    via cutting)

    AVRO-123.  Fix Java's specific protocol compiler so that
    parameters and return types are unboxed. (cutting)

    AVRO-125.  Fix sample protocol in specification document to use
    the correct syntax.  (cutting)

    (Eelco Hillenius via cutting)

Avro 1.1.0 (8 September 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-110. GenericData and ReflectData have been converted to use a
    singleton pattern.  Calls to static methods on these classes must
    be replaced with calls on the singleton instance. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. GenericArray's constructor now requires a Schema, so that
    it may implement Comparable consistently with AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Several GenericDatumWriter methods (instanceOf(),
    isRecord(), etc.) have been moved to GenericData, where they can
    better be shared with comparators.  Applications which subclassed
    GenericDatumWriter overriding these methods must now instead
    subclass GenericData and pass their subclass to
    GenericDatumWriter. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. SpecificRecord's schema() method has been renamed
    getSchema(), since it now implements the new GenericContainer
    interface shared with GenericRecord. (cutting)

    M. G. & cutting)

    AVRO-76. Add Java RPC plugin framework.  (George Porter)

    AVRO-104. Permit null fields in Java reflection.

    AVRO-92. Describe JSON data encoding in specification
    document. (cutting)

    AVRO-108.  Add Java implementation of binary comparator.
    (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Java generic and specific data instances now implement
    Comparable.  The implementation is consistent with the binary
    comparator added in AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-109.  Add Java support for controlling sort order via schema
    annotations.  Record fields now support an "order" attribute whose
    possible values are "increasing" (the default), "decreasing", and
    "ignore".  (cutting)

    AVRO-111.  Document sort ordering in the specification. (cutting)

  IMPROVEMENTS

    AVRO-71.  C++: make deserializer more generic.  (Scott Banachowski
    via cutting)

    multi-byte characters.  Add tests.  (Matt Massie via cutting)

    document.  (Thiruvalluvan M. G. and cutting)

    AVRO-89. In fields of Java generated classes, use unboxed numeric
    types.  (cutting)

    AVRO-83. In generated Java code, elide unions with null. (cutting)

    order and to ignore extra attributes. (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    change test-java build target to fail on javadoc warnings.
    (Thiruvalluvan M. G. and cutting)

    AVRO-90. Fix Java's JSON codec to correctly encode unions. (cutting)

    AVRO-95. Fix writing of Java reflect-based unions.  Also extend
    DataFileWriter to permit adding branches to a union schema while
    writing.

    AVRO-88. Fix Java's BlockingBinaryEncoder to correctly override
    writeEnum().  (Ravi Gummadi via cutting)

    AVRO-61. Add Python support for reading blocked data.
    (Ravi Gummadi via cutting)

    AVRO-97.  Fix various C++ bugs.  (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    AVRO-100.  In spec, remove warning about blocking being draft. (cutting)

    AVRO-107.  Fix Protocol#equals() and Protocol#hashCode() to
    consider the protocol's types, and also fix Schema#equals() to not
    throw ClassCastException when a fixed schema is compared to
    non-fixed. (cutting)

    AVRO-112.  Turn off C++ debug output.  (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    AVRO-114.  Fix "cdoc" Ant target to correctly run doxygen.
    (Matt Massie via cutting)
