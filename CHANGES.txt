Avro 1.5.0 (10 March 2011)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-751. C: Each avro_datum_t instance now contains a reference to
    the schema that the datum is an instance of.  As a result, the
    signatures of several of the functions that operate on avro_datum_t
    instances have changed.

    AVRO-647. Java: Break avro.jar up into multiple parts: avro.jar,
    avro-compiler.jar, avro-ipc.jar, avro-mapred.jar, avro-tools.jar,
    and avro-maven-plugin.jar.
    
    Summary of artifacts: 
    * avro.jar
      Contains 'core' avro features:  schemas, data files,
      specific, generic, and reflect APIs.
      Dependencies: slf4j, Paranamer, Jackson.
    * avro-ipc.jar
      Contains Trancievers, Requestors, and Responders.
      Dependencies:  avro.jar, Jetty, Netty, and Velocity
    * avro-compiler.jar
      Contains SpecificCompiler, IDL compiler and Ant tasks.
      Dependencies: avro.jar, commmons-lang, and Velocity.
    * avro-maven-plugin.jar
      A Maven plugin for Avro's compiler.
      Dependencies: avro-compiler.jar
    * avro-mapred.jar
      API for Hadoop MapReduce with Avro data.
      Dependencies: avro-ipc.jar, hadoop-core, and jopt-simple.
    * avro-tools.jar
      Avro command-line tools stand-alone jar.
      Dependencies are contained within the jar.
      Dependencies: all of the above.

    AVRO-737. Java: Improve correlation between packages and modules.
    Each module introduced by AVRO-647 now exclusively provides 
    different java packages.  This required moving several classes
    around into new packages and will therefore require users to
    change their package imports when upgrading to Avro 1.5.0.
    Summary of changes:
    * AvroRemoteException has moved to org.apache.avro
    * ByteBufferInputStream and ByteBufferInputStream have moved 
      to org.apache.avro.util
    * InduceSchemaTool has moved to org.apache.avro.tools
    * SpecificCompiler, SchemaTask, and ProtocolTask have moved 
      to org.apache.avro.compiler.specific
    * The Idl compiler has moved to org.apache.avro.compiler.idl
    * ReflectRequestor and ReflectResponder have moved to
      org.apache.avro.ipc.reflect
    * GenericRequestor and GenericResponder have moved to
      org.apache.avro.ipc.generic
    * SpecificRequestor and SpecificResponder have moved to
      org.apache.avro.ipc.specific
    (scottcarey)

    AVRO-753. Java: Improve BinaryEncoder Performance.
    The Encoder API has several resulting changes:
    * Construction and configuration is handled by EncoderFactory.  All 
      Constructors are hidden, and Encoder.init(OutputStream) is removed.
    * Some Encoders previously did not buffer output.  Users must call
      Encoder.flush() to ensure output is written unless the EncoderFactory
      method used to construct an instance explicitly states that the Encoder
      does not buffer output. 
    (scottcarey)

    AVRO-769. Java: Align Decoder/Encoder APIs for consistency and long term
    stability.  Avro's Decoder and Encoder APIs are aligned and now consist of 
    only read and write operations.  EncoderFactory and DecoderFactory handle
    all construction and common configuration.  Some specialized implementations
    have separate configuration APIs. 
     
    (scottcarey)

    AVRO-670. Allow DataFileWriteTool to accept schema files as input with new
    --schema-file and --schema command-line flags. (Ron Bodkin via philz)

    AVRO-671. Java: Check that type and field names conform to
    specified requirements. (cutting)

    AVRO-678. Java: Implement ReflectData#compare().  Incompatibly
    moves some protected GenericDatumReader/Writer methods to
    GenericData, potentially breaking subclasses. (cutting)

    AVRO-696. Java: Make DataFileWriter.setMetaInternal(String,String)
    private. (Patrick Linehan via cutting)    

    AVRO-741. C: Minor API change to handling of bytes data.
    (Douglas Creager via brucem)

    AVRO-246. Java: Add required Schema parameter to GenericData.Fixed
    and GenericData.EnumSymbol constructors.  Also fix union dispatch
    to conform to specification, using full schema name for records,
    enums and fixed.

  NEW FEATURES

    AVRO-762. C: New and improved schema resolution API.  The new API
    correctly handles all of the schema resolution rules listed in the
    spec.  It performs resolution against two schemas separately from
    reading in any data, so that we don't have to re-resolve for each
    data record.  Please see the avro/consumer.h header file for
    details. (dcreager)

    AVRO-463. C: Error message API.  The new avro_strerror() function
    can be used to get a textual description of the error codes returned
    by the other C API functions.  In particular, this includes any JSON
    parse errors that occur while trying to load a schema. (dcreager)

    AVRO-684. Java: Add command-line "recodec" tool to change file
    compression codecs.  (Patrick Linehan via cutting)

    re-reading the header. (Stu Hood via cutting)

Avro 1.2.0 (14 October 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-115. Remove RPC's session notion to facilliate the use of
    stateless transports like UDP and HTTP.  Add a UDP transport.
    (cutting)

    AVRO-120. Improved package and namespace handling, including:

     * Removed explicit package-name specification from specific and
       reflect public APIs.  Package names are now determined either
       by namespace declarations or by a Java classes, as appropriate.

     * Changed the specific compiler to generate separate java files
       per class, rather than nested classes.  This permits generated
       classes to be in packages declared in their schema namespaces.

     * Fix namespace defaulting.  The default namespace is declared in
       the outermost schema or protocol.  Nested schemas can now
       declare different namespaces than the default.

     * Names may now be specified with a dotted notation, e.g.,
       "foo.bar.Baz", to indicate the name "Baz" in namespace
       "foo.bar".  This permits one to refer to schemas in a namespace
       other than the default.

  NEW FEATURES

    AVRO-121.  Permit reflect and specific datum readers to read data
    written with a different version of the schema than is current.

Avro 1.1.0 (8 September 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-110. GenericData and ReflectData have been converted to use a
    singleton pattern.  Calls to static methods on these classes must
    be replaced with calls on the singleton instance. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. GenericArray's constructor now requires a Schema, so that
    it may implement Comparable consistently with AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Several GenericDatumWriter methods (instanceOf(),
    isRecord(), etc.) have been moved to GenericData, where they can
    better be shared with comparators.  Applications which subclassed
    GenericDatumWriter overriding these methods must now instead
    subclass GenericData and pass their subclass to
    GenericDatumWriter. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. SpecificRecord's schema() method has been renamed
    getSchema(), since it now implements the new GenericContainer
    interface shared with GenericRecord. (cutting)

  NEW FEATURES

    M. G. & cutting)

    AVRO-41. Java generic and specific data instances now implement
    Comparable.  The implementation is consistent with the binary
    comparator added in AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-109.  Add Java support for controlling sort order via schema
    annotations.  Record fields now support an "order" attribute whose
    possible values are "increasing" (the default), "decreasing", and
    "ignore".  (cutting)

    AVRO-95. Fix writing of Java reflect-based unions.  Also extend
    DataFileWriter to permit adding branches to a union schema while
    writing.

    AVRO-88. Fix Java's BlockingBinaryEncoder to correctly override
    writeEnum().  (Ravi Gummadi via cutting)
