Revision history for Perl extension Avro

        - Switch from JSON::XS to JSON::MaybeXS to support
          multiple JSON backends
        - Drop dependency on IO::String, since we don't need
          it now we depend on Perl 5.10.1 or greater
        - Support object containers without an explicit
          codec. It will be assumed to be 'null' as mandated
          by the spec.
        - Fixed an issue that meant the minimum accepted values
          for int and long types were off by one
        - Silenced a spurious warning that was raised when
          validating an undefined value for some data types
        - Make sure Unicode strings are downgraded when they
          are encoded in fields of type 'byte' or 'fixed'.
          Errors resulting from this process will be raised as
          Avro::BinaryEncoder::Error exceptions
        - Fixed a bug with the detection of valid boolean values
          which was not using anchors in a regular expression.
          Valid values are (case insensitively) 'yes', 'y', 'no',
          'n', 'true', 't', 'false', 'f', 0, 1, and anything that
          is accepted by JSON::PP::is_bool. References rejected by
          this last function are not valid
        - Fixed some issues around the binary encoding of boolean
          values. In particular, Avro::BinaryEncoder now correctly
          encodes all the values that Avro::Schema accepts as
          valid boolean values, which before were blindly evaluated
          in boolean context resulting in strings like 'false'
          being serialised as if they were true
