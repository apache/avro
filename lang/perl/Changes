Revision history for Perl extension Avro

        - Switch from JSON::XS to JSON::MaybeXS to support
          multiple JSON backends
        - Drop dependency on IO::String, since we don't need
          it now we depend on Perl 5.10.1 or greater
        - Support object containers without an explicit
          codec. It will be assumed to be 'null' as mandated
          by the spec.
        - Fixed an issue that meant the minimum accepted values
          for int and long types were off by one
        - Silenced a spurious warning that was raised when
          validating an undefined value for some data types
