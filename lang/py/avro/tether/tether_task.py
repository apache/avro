    Base class for python tether mapreduce programs.

    ToDo: Currently the subclass has to implement both reduce and reduceFlush.
    This is not very pythonic. A pythonic way to implement the reducer
    would be to pass the reducer a generator (as dumbo does) so that the user
    could iterate over the records for the given key.
    How would we do this. I think we would need to have two threads, one thread would run
    the user's reduce function. This loop would be suspended when no reducer records were available.
    The other thread would read in the records for the reducer. This thread should
    only buffer so many records at a time (i.e if the buffer is full, self.input shouldn't return right

        outschema - The scheme for the output of the reducer
