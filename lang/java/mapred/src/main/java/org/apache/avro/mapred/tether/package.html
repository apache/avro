<body>
Run <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> MapReduce jobs over
Avro data, with map and reduce functions run in a sub-process.  This
permits MapReduce programs over Avro data in languages besides Java.
<p>
Each language will provide a framework to permit easy implementation
of MapReduce programs in that language.  Currently only a Java
framework has been implemented, for test purposes, so this feature is
not yet useful.
<p>
This is still an experimental API, subject to change.
