<body>
Implementation of Avro schemas as LL(1) grammars.

<p>See
<a href="doc-files/parsing.html">parser documentation</a> for details on how
this is achieved.

<p>
The classes in this package are used by
{@link org.apache.avro.io.ValidatingEncoder},
{@link org.apache.avro.io.ValidatingDecoder},
{@link org.apache.avro.io.ResolvingDecoder},
{@link org.apache.avro.io.JsonEncoder} and
{@link org.apache.avro.io.JsonDecoder},

<p>
Unless one plans to generate a variation of the grammar or use a grammar,
one not need to understand these classes.
