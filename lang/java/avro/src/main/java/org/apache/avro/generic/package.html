<body>
A generic representation for Avro data.

<p>This representation is best for applications which deal with
  dynamic data, whose schemas are not known until runtime.

<p>Avro schemas are mapped to Java types as follows:
<ul>
<li>Schema records are implemented as {@link org.apache.avro.generic.GenericRecord}.
<li>Schema enums are implemented as {@link org.apache.avro.generic.GenericEnumSymbol}.
<li>Schema arrays are implemented as {@link java.util.Collection}.
<li>Schema maps are implemented as {@link java.util.Map}.
<li>Schema fixed are implemented as {@link org.apache.avro.generic.GenericFixed}.
<li>Schema strings are implemented as {@link java.lang.CharSequence}.
<li>Schema bytes are implemented as {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}.
<li>Schema ints are implemented as {@link java.lang.Integer}.
<li>Schema longs are implemented as {@link java.lang.Long}.
<li>Schema floats are implemented as {@link java.lang.Float}.
<li>Schema doubles are implemented as {@link java.lang.Double}.
<li>Schema booleans are implemented as {@link java.lang.Boolean}.
</ul>
