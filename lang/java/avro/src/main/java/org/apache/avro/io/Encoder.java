/**
 * Low-level support for serializing Avro values.
 * <p/>
 * This class has two types of methods.  One type of methods support
 * the writing of leaf values (for example, {@link #writeLong} and
 * {@link #writeString}).  These methods have analogs in {@link
 * Decoder}.
 * <p/>
 * The other type of methods support the writing of maps and arrays.
 * These methods are {@link #writeArrayStart}, {@link
 * #startItem}, and {@link #writeArrayEnd} (and similar methods for
 * maps).  Some implementations of {@link Encoder} handle the
 * buffering required to break large maps and arrays into blocks,
 * which is necessary for applications that want to do streaming.
 * (See {@link #writeArrayStart} for details on these methods.)
 * <p/>
 * {@link EncoderFactory} contains Encoder construction and configuration
 * facilities.
