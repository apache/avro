<body>Avro kernel classes.

<p>A {@link org.apache.avro.Schema} provides an abstract definition of
  a data type.

<p>The in-memory representation of data is determined by {@link
  org.apache.avro.io.DatumReader} and {@link
  org.apache.avro.io.DatumWriter} implementations.  Generic
  implementations are provided in the {@link org.apache.avro.generic}
  package.  A {@link org.apache.avro.compiler.specific.SpecificCompiler
  compiler} can generate specific java classes and interfaces for
  schemas and protocols.  Schemas may be automatically generated for
  existing Java classes by reflection using the {@link
  org.apache.avro.reflect} package.

<p>Data of a given schema is always serialized identically, regardless
  of its in-memory representation, by traversing the schema and
  writing leaf values from the data structure with a {@link
  org.apache.avro.io.Encoder}.  Deserializing similarly proceeds by
  traversing the schema, reading leaf values with a {@link
  org.apache.avro.io.Decoder} and storing them in an in-memory data
  structure.
