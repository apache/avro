/** An {@link org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.OutputFormat} that writes Avro data to
 * Trevni files.
 *
 * This implement was modeled off
 * {@link org.apache.avro.mapreduce.AvroKeyOutputFormat} to allow for easy
 * transition
 *
 * FileOutputFormat for writing Trevni container files.
 *
 * <p>Since Trevni container files only contain records (not key/value pairs), this output
 * format ignores the value.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> The (java) type of the Trevni data to write.
 *
 * <p>Writes a directory of files per task, each comprising a single filesystem
 * block.  To reduce the number of files, increase the default filesystem block
 * size for the job.  Each task also requires enough memory to buffer a
 * filesystem block.
