<body>Read and write <a href="https://avro.apache.org/">Avro</a> data
in Trevni column files.</body>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

The current implementation does not correctly handle all Avro data.
In particular:

<ul>
  <li>Recursive types are not supported.</li>
  <li>With ReflectData, fields of Java type <b>byte</b>, <b>short</b>
    and <b>char</b> are not supported.  Instead use int. </li>
  <li>With ReflectData, Java arrays are not supported.  Instead use
  List. </li>
  <li>An <b>enum</b> is always read as a GenericData.EnumSymbol, even
    when SpecificData or ReflectData are used. </li>
</ul>
