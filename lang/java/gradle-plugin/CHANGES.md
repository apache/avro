# Pre-1.0 Versions

These versions used a different publishing process.  They use different coordinates/packages and may no longer be available in a traditional Maven repository.  It is strongly recommended to upgrade to a newer version.

If you still need to use them, the artifacts can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin/releases) or accessed via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin).
The plugin IDs are `com.commercehub.gradle.plugin.avro` and `com.commercehub.gradle.plugin.avro-base`, with all tasks in the package `com.commercehub.gradle.plugin.avro`.

## 0.22.0
* Add [Configuration Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/6.6/userguide/configuration_cache.html) support (#129; thanks to [dcabasson](https://github.com/dcabasson) and [eskatos](https://github.com/eskatos))
* Add coverage reporting via JaCoco/Codecov to the plugin's build pipeline
* Add support for multiple IDL files with the same name in different directories (#123)
  * The `.avpr` file generated by `GenerateAvroProtocolTask` is now based on the namespace and name of the protocol, rather than the name of the `.avdl` file.
* Built using Avro 1.10.1
* Built using Gradle 6.7.1
* Updated compatibility testing to include Java 15
* Updated compatibility testing through Gradle 6.7.1
