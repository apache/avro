The old logo was derived from the logo of a (now defunct) aircraft manufacturer in Great Britain. This posed a risk, as the Apache foundation would not contest legal action (even if extremely unlikely).
But thanks to Emma Kellam, we now have a new logo! She has made several logo designs, and after some debate and several votes (it was a close call!</description></item><item><title>New committer: Christophe Le Saec</title><link>/blog/2023/08/09/new-committer-christophe-le-saec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/08/09/new-committer-christophe-le-saec/</guid><description>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited Christophe Le Saec to become a committer and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.
Christophe definitely puts in the work and, has an impressive breadth of knowledge about the languages of the Avro SDK!
As an ASF project, we tend to be very conservative about making changes, and Christophe brings in fresh ideas and very quickly proposes concrete implementations to prove them.</description></item><item><title>New committer: Oscar Westra van Holthe - Kind</title><link>/blog/2023/08/09/new-committer-oscar-westra-van-holthe-kind/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/08/09/new-committer-oscar-westra-van-holthe-kind/</guid><description>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro has invited Oscar Westra van Holthe - Kind to become a committer and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.
Oscar has done some really solid work on the IDL and JavaCC parts of the Java SDK. We trust his work and think it&amp;rsquo;s exceptionally high quality. From the start, he has already doing much of the work of a committer, demonstrated by his continuous presence in commenting JIRA, reviewing PRs as well as encouraging and insightful words on the mailing list.</description></item><item><title>New PMC member: Michael A.

Zoltan has been present in the C# SDK for over two years and has really increased his activity in maintaining this language in the last few months.
