      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>This document defines Avro.  It is intended to be the
        authoritative specification. Implementations of Avro must
        adhere to this document.

    <section id="schemas">
      <title>Schema Declaration</title>
      <p>A Schema is represented in <a href="ext:json">JSON</a> by one of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A JSON string, naming a defined type.</li>
        
        <li>A JSON object, of the form:
          
          <source>{"type": "<em>typeName</em>" ...<em>attributes</em>...}</source>

          where <em>typeName</em> is either a primitive or derived
          type name, as defined below.  Attributes not defined in this
          document are permitted as metadata, but must not affect
          the format of serialized data.
          </li>
        <li>A JSON array, representing a union of embedded types.</li>
      </ul>

      <section id="schema_primitive">
        <title>Primitive Types</title>
        <p>The set of primitive type names is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>string</code>: unicode character sequence</li>
          <li><code>bytes</code>: sequence of 8-bit bytes</li>
          <li><code>int</code>: 32-bit signed integer</li>
          <li><code>long</code>: 64-bit signed integer</li>
          <li><code>float</code>: single precision (32-bit) IEEE 754 floating-point number</li>
          <li><code>double</code>: double precision (64-bit) IEEE 754 floating-point number</li>
          <li><code>boolean</code>: a binary value</li>
          <li><code>null</code>: no value</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Primitive types have no specified attributes.</p>
        
        <p>Primitive type names are also defined type names.  Thus, for
          example, the schema "string" is equivalent to:</p>
        
        <source>{"type": "string"}</source>

      </section>

      <section id="schema_complex">
        <title>Complex Types</title>
        
        <p>Avro supports six kinds of complex types: records, enums,
        arrays, maps, unions and fixed.</p>

        <section id="schema_record">
          <title>Records</title>
          
	  <p>Records use the type name "record" and support three attributes:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><code>name</code>: a JSON string providing the name
	    of the record (required).</li>
	    <li><em>namespace</em>, a JSON string that qualifies the name;</li>
	    <li><code>doc</code>: a JSON string providing documentation to the
	    user of this schema (optional).</li>
	    <li><code>fields</code>: a JSON array, listing fields (required).
	    Each field is a JSON object with the following attributes:
	      <ul>
		<li><code>name</code>: a JSON string providing the name
		  of the field (required), and </li>
		<li><code>doc</code>: a JSON string describing this field
                  for users (optional).</li>
		<li><code>type:</code> A JSON object defining a schema, or
		  a JSON string naming a record definition
		  (required).</li>
		<li><code>default:</code> A default value for this
		  field, used when reading instances that lack this
		  field (optional).  Permitted values depend on the
		  field's schema type, according to the table below.
		  Default values for union fields correspond to the
		  first schema in the union.
		  <table class="right">
		    <caption>field default values</caption>
		    <tr><th>avro type</th><th>json type</th><th>example</th></tr>
		    <tr><td>string</td><td>string</td><td>"foo"</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>bytes</td><td>string</td><td>"\u00FF"</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>int,long</td><td>integer</td><td>1</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>float,double</td><td>number</td><td>1.1</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>boolean</td><td>boolean</td><td>true</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>record</td><td>object</td><td>{"a": 1}</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>enum</td><td>string</td><td>"FOO"</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>array</td><td>array</td><td>[1]</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>map</td><td>object</td><td>{"a": 1}</td></tr>
		    <tr><td>fixed</td><td>string</td><td>"\u00ff"</td></tr>
		  </table>
		</li>
		<li><code>order:</code> specifies how this field
		  impacts sort ordering of this record (optional).
		  Valid values are "ascending" (the default),
		  "descending", or "ignore".  For more details on how
		  this is used, see the the <a href="#order">sort
		  order</a> section below.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>For example, a linked-list of 64-bit values may be defined with:</p>
	  <source>
{
  "type": "record", 
  "name": "LongList",
  "fields" : [
    {"name": "value", "type": "long"},             // each element has a long
    {"name": "next", "type": ["LongList", "null"]} // optional next element
  ]
}
	  </source>
	</section>
        
        <section>
          <title>Enums</title>
          
	  <p>Enums use the type name "enum" and support the following
	  attributes:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><code>name</code>: a JSON string providing the name
	    of the enum (required).</li>
	    <li><em>namespace</em>, a JSON string that qualifies the name;</li>
	    <li><code>doc</code>: a JSON string providing documentation to the
	    user of this schema (optional).</li>
	    <li><code>symbols</code>: a JSON array, listing symbols,
	    as JSON strings (required).</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>For example, playing card suits might be defined with:</p>
	  <source>
{ "type": "enum",
  "name": "Suit",
  "symbols" : ["SPADES", "HEARTS", "DIAMONDS", "CLUBS"]
}
	  </source>
	</section>
        
        <section>
          <title>Arrays</title>
          <p>Arrays use the type name <code>"array"</code> and support
          a single attribute:</p>
	  <ul>
            <li><code>items</code>: the schema of the array's items.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>For example, an array of strings is declared
	  with:</p>
	  <source>{"type": "array", "items": "string"}</source>
	</section>

        <section>
          <title>Maps</title>
          <p>Maps use the type name <code>"map"</code> and support
          one attribute:</p>
	  <ul>
            <li><code>values</code>: the schema of the map's values.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Map keys are assumed to be strings.</p>
	  <p>For example, a map from string to long is declared
	  with:</p>
	  <source>{"type": "map", "values": "long"}</source>
	</section>

        <section>
          <title>Unions</title>
          <p>Unions, as mentioned above, are represented using JSON
          arrays.  For example, <code>["string", "null"]</code>
          declares a schema which may be either a string or null.</p>
	  <p>Unions may not contain more than one schema with the same
	  type, except for the named types record, fixed and enum.  For
	  example, unions containing two array types or two map types
	  are not permitted, but two types with different names are
	  permitted.  (Names permit efficient resolution when reading
	  and writing unions.)</p>
	  <p>Unions may not immediately contain other unions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Fixed</title>
          <p>Fixed uses the type name <code>"fixed"</code> and supports
          two attributes:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><code>name</code>: a string naming this fixed (required).</li>
	    <li><em>namespace</em>, a string that qualifies the name;</li>
            <li><code>size</code>: an integer, specifying the number
            of bytes per value (required).</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>For example, 16-byte quantity may be declared with:</p>
	  <source>{"type": "fixed", "size": 16, "name": "md5"}</source>
	</section>


      </section> <!-- end complex types -->

      <section>
	<title>Names</title>
        <p>Record, enums and fixed are named types.  Each has
          a <em>fullname</em> that is composed of two parts;
          a <em>name</em> and a <em>namespace</em>.  Equality of names
          is defined on the fullname.</p>
	<p>The name portion of a fullname, and record field names must:</p>
	<ul>
          <li>start with <code>[A-Za-z_]</code></li>
          <li>subsequently contain only <code>[A-Za-z0-9_]</code></li>
	</ul>
        <p>A namespace is a dot-separated sequence of such names.</p>
        <p>In record, enum and fixed definitions, the fullname is
        determined in one of the following ways:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A name and namespace are both specified.  For example,
	  one might use <code>"name": "X", "namespace":
	  "org.foo"</code> to indicate the
	  fullname <code>org.foo.X</code>.</li>
	  <li>A fullname is specified.  If the name specified contains
	  a dot, then it is assumed to be a fullname, and any
	  namespace also specified is ignored.  For example,
	  use <code>"name": "org.foo.X"</code> to indicate the
	  fullname <code>org.foo.X</code>.</li>
	  <li>A name only is specified, i.e., a name that contains no
	  dots.  In this case the namespace is taken from the most
	  tightly encosing schema or protocol.  For example,
	  if <code>"name": "X"</code> is specified, and this occurs
	  within a field of the record definition
	  of <code>org.foo.Y</code>, then the fullname
	  is <code>org.foo.X</code>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>References to previously defined names are as in the latter
	two cases above: if they contain a dot they are a fullname, if
	they do not contain a dot, the namespace is the namespace of
	the enclosing definition.</p>
	<p>Primitive type names have no namespace and their names may
	not be defined in any namespace.  A schema may only contain
	multiple definitions of a fullname if the definitions are
	equivalent.</p>
      </section>

    </section> <!-- end schemas -->

    <section>
      <title>Data Serialization</title>

      <p>Avro data is always serialized with its schema.  Files that
	store Avro data should always also include the schema for that
	data in the same file.  Avro-based remote procedure call (RPC)
	systems must also guarantee that remote recipients of data
	have a copy of the schema used to write that data.</p>

      <p>Because the schema used to write data is always available
	when the data is read, Avro data itself is not tagged with
	type information.  The schema is required to parse data.</p>

      <p>In general, both serialization and deserialization proceed as
      a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the schema,
      serializing primitive types as they are encountered.</p>

      <section>
	<title>Encodings</title>
	<p>Avro specifies two serialization encodings: binary and
	  JSON.  Most applications will use the binary encoding, as it
	  is smaller and faster.  But, for debugging and web-based
	  applications, the JSON encoding may sometimes be
	  appropriate.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="binary_encoding">
        <title>Binary Encoding</title>

	<section id="binary_encode_primitive">
          <title>Primitive Types</title>
          <p>Primitive types are encoded in binary as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a <code>string</code> is encoded as
              a <code>long</code> followed by that many bytes of UTF-8
              encoded character data.
	      <p>For example, the three-character string "foo" would
		be encoded as the long value 3 (encoded as
		hex <code>06</code>) followed by the UTF-8 encoding of
		'f', 'o', and 'o' (the hex bytes <code>66 6f
		6f</code>):
	      </p>
	      <source>06 66 6f 6f</source>
	    </li>
            <li><code>bytes</code> are encoded as
              a <code>long</code> followed by that many bytes of data.
	    </li>
            <li><code>int</code> and <code>long</code> values are written
              using <a href="ext:vint">variable-length</a>
	      <a href="ext:zigzag">zig-zag</a> coding.  Some examples:
	      <table class="right">
		<tr><th>value</th><th>hex</th></tr>
		<tr><td><code> 0</code></td><td><code>00</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>-1</code></td><td><code>01</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td><code> 1</code></td><td><code>02</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>-2</code></td><td><code>03</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td><code> 2</code></td><td><code>04</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan="2"><code>...</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>-64</code></td><td><code>7f</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td><code> 64</code></td><td><code>&nbsp;80 01</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan="2"><code>...</code></td></tr>
	      </table>
	    </li>
            <li>a <code>float</code> is written as 4 bytes. The float is
              converted into a 32-bit integer using a method equivalent
              to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#floatToIntBits%28float%29">Java's floatToIntBits</a> and then encoded
              in little-endian format.</li>
            <li>a <code>double</code> is written as 8 bytes. The double
              is converted into a 64-bit integer using a method equivalent
              to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#doubleToLongBits%28double%29">Java's
		doubleToLongBits</a> and then encoded in little-endian
              format.</li>
            <li>a <code>boolean</code> is written as a single byte whose
              value is either <code>0</code> (false) or <code>1</code>
              (true).</li>
            <li><code>null</code> is written as zero bytes.</li>
          </ul>

	<section id="binary_encode_complex">
          <title>Complex Types</title>
          <p>Complex types are encoded in binary as follows:</p>

          <section>
            <title>Records</title>
	    <p>A record is encoded by encoding the values of its
	      fields in the order that they are declared.  In other
	      words, a record is encoded as just the concatenation of
	      the encodings of its fields.  Field values are encoded per
	      their schema.</p>
	    <p>For example, the record schema</p>
	    <source>
	      {
	      "type": "record", 
	      "name": "test",
	      "fields" : [
	      {"name": "a", "type": "long"},
	      {"name": "b", "type": "string"}
	      ]
	      }
	    </source>
	    <p>An instance of this record whose <code>a</code> field has
	      value 27 (encoded as hex <code>36</code>) and
	      whose <code>b</code> field has value "foo" (encoded as hex
	      bytes <code>06 66 6f 6f</code>), would be encoded simply
	      as the concatenation of these, namely the hex byte
	      sequence:</p>
	    <source>36 06 66 6f 6f</source>
	  </section>
          
          <section>
            <title>Enums</title>
            <p>An enum is encoded by a <code>int</code>, representing
              the zero-based position of the symbol in the schema.</p>
	    <p>For example, consider the enum:</p>
	    <source>
	      {"type": "enum", "name": "Foo", "symbols": ["A", "B", "C", "D"] }
	    </source>
	    <p>This would be encoded by an <code>int</code> between
	      zero and three, with zero indicating "A", and 3 indicating
	      "D".</p>
	  </section>


          <section>
            <title>Arrays</title>
            <p>Arrays are encoded as a series of <em>blocks</em>.
              Each block consists of a <code>long</code> <em>count</em>
              value, followed by that many array items.  A block with
              count zero indicates the end of the array.  Each item is
              encoded per the array's item schema.</p>

	    <p>If a block's count is negative, then the count is
	      followed immediately by a <code>long</code>
	      block <em>size</em>, indicating the number of bytes in the
	      block.  The actual count in this case is the absolute value
	      of the count written.</p>

	    <p>For example, the array schema</p>
	    <source>{"type": "array", "items": "long"}</source>
	    <p>an array containing the items 3 and 27 could be encoded
	      as the long value 2 (encoded as hex 04) followed by long
	      values 3 and 27 (encoded as hex <code>06 36</code>)
	      terminated by zero:</p>
	    <source>04 06 36 00</source>

	    <p>The blocked representation permits one to read and write
	      arrays larger than can be buffered in memory, since one can
	      start writing items without knowing the full length of the
	      array.  The optional block sizes permit fast skipping
	      through data, e.g., when projecting a record to a subset of
	      its fields.</p>

	  </section>

          <section>
            <title>Maps</title>
            <p>Maps are encoded as a series of <em>blocks</em>.  Each
              block consists of a <code>long</code> <em>count</em>
              value, followed by that many key/value pairs.  A block
              with count zero indicates the end of the map.  Each item
              is encoded per the map's value schema.</p>

	    <p>If a block's count is negative, then the count is
	      followed immediately by a <code>long</code>
	      block <em>size</em>, indicating the number of bytes in the
	      block.  The actual count in this case is the absolute value
	      of the count written.</p>

	    <p>The blocked representation permits one to read and write
	      maps larger than can be buffered in memory, since one can
	      start writing items without knowing the full length of the
	      map.  The optional block sizes permit fast skipping through
	      data, e.g., when projecting a record to a subset of its
	      fields.</p>

	    <p><em>NOTE: Blocking has not yet been fully implemented and
		may change.  Arbitrarily large objects must be easily
		writable and readable but until we have proven this with an
		implementation and tests this part of the specification
		should be considered draft.</em></p>
	  </section>

          <section>
            <title>Unions</title>
	    <p>A union is encoded by first writing a <code>long</code>
	      value indicating the zero-based position within the
	      union of the schema of its value.  The value is then
	      encoded per the indicated schema within the union.</p>
	    <p>For example, the union
	      schema <code>["string","null"]</code> would encode:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>null</code> as the integer 1 (the index of
		"null" in the union, encoded as
		hex <code>02</code>): <source>02</source></li>
              <li>the string <code>"a"</code> as zero (the index of
		"string" in the union), followed by the serialized string:
		<source>00 02 61</source></li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Fixed</title>
	    <p>Fixed instances are encoded using the number of bytes
	      declared in the schema.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="json_encoding">
        <title>JSON Encoding</title>
	
	<p>Except for unions, the JSON encoding is the same as is used
	to encode <a href="#schema_record">field default
	values</a>.</p>

	<p>The value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>if its type is <code>null</code>, then it is encoded as
	  a JSON null;</li>
	  <li>otherwise it is encoded as a JSON object with one
	  name/value pair whose name is the type's name and whose
	  value is the recursively encoded value.  For Avro's named
	  types (record, fixed or enum) the user-specified name is
	  used, for other types the type name is used.</li>
	</ul>
	  
	<p>For example, the union
	  schema <code>["null","string","Foo"]</code>, where Foo is a
	  record name, would encode:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>null</code> as <code>null</code>;</li>
          <li>the string <code>"a"</code> as
	    <code>{"string": "a"}</code>; and</li>
          <li>a Foo instance as <code>{"Foo": {...}}</code>,
          where <code>{...}</code> indicates the JSON encoding of a
          Foo instance.</li>
        </ul>

	<p>Note that a schema is still required to correctly process
	JSON-encoded data.  For example, the JSON encoding does not
	distinguish between <code>int</code>
	and <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>
	and <code>double</code>, records and maps, enums and strings,
	etc.</p>

    <section id="order">
      <title>Sort Order</title>

      <p>Avro defines a standard sort order for data.  This permits
	data written by one system to be efficiently sorted by another
	system.  This can be an important optimization, as sort order
	comparisons are sometimes the most frequent per-object
	operation.  Note also that Avro binary-encoded data can be
	efficiently ordered without deserializing it to objects.</p>

      <p>Data items may only be compared if they have identical
	schemas.  Pairwise comparisons are implemented recursively
	with a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the schema.
	The first mismatch encountered determines the order of the
	items.</p>

      <p>Two items with the same schema are compared according to the
	following rules.</p>
      <ul>
	<li><code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>
	  and <code>double</code> data is ordered by ascending numeric
	  value.</li>
	<li><code>boolean</code> data is ordered with false before true.</li>
	<li><code>null</code> data is always equal.</li>
	<li><code>string</code> data is compared lexicographically.
	  Note that since UTF-8 is used as the binary encoding of
	  strings, sorting by bytes and characters is equivalent.</li>
	<li><code>bytes</code> and <code>fixed</code> data are
	  compared lexicographically by byte.</li>
	<li><code>array</code> data is compared lexicographically by
	  element.</li>
	<li><code>enum</code> data is ordered by the symbol's position
	  in the enum schema.  For example, an enum whose symbols are
	  <code>["z", "a"]</code> would sort <code>"z"</code> values
	  before <code>"a"</code> values.</li>
	<li><code>union</code> data is first ordered by the branch
	  within the union, and, within that, by the type of the
	  branch.  For example, an <code>["int", "string"]</code>
	  union would order all int values before all string values,
	  with the ints and strings themselves ordered as defined
	  above.</li>
	<li><code>record</code> data is ordered lexicographically by
	  field.  If a field specifies that its order is:
	  <ul>
	    <li><code>"ascending"</code>, then the order of its values
	      is unaltered.</li>
	    <li><code>"ascending"</code>, then the order of its values
	      is reversed.</li>
	    <li><code>"ignore"</code>, then its values are ignored
	      when sorting.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>map</code> data may not be compared.  It is an error
	  to attempt to compare data containing maps unless those maps
	  are in an <code>"order":"ignore"</code> record field.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Object Container Files</title>
      <p>Avro includes a simple object container file format.  A file
      has a schema, and all objects stored in the file must be written
      according to that schema.  Objects are stored in blocks that may
      be compressed.  Syncronization markers are used between blocks
      to permit efficient splitting of files for MapReduce
      processing.</p>

      <p>Files may include arbitrary user-specified metadata.</p>

      <p>A file consists of:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A <em>file header</em>, followed by</li>
	<li>one or more <em>file data blocks</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A file header consists of:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Four bytes, ASCII 'O', 'b', 'j', followed by 1.</li>
	<li><em>file metadata</em>, including the schema.</li>
	<li>The 16-byte, randomly-generated sync marker for this file.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>File metadata consists of:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A long indicating the number of metadata key/value pairs.</li>
	<li>For each pair, a string key and bytes value.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following file metadata properties are reserved:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>schema</strong> contains the schema of objects
	stored in the file, as JSON data (required).</li>
	<li><strong>codec</strong> the name of the compression codec
	used to compress blocks, as a string. The only value for codec
	currently supported is "null" (meaning no compression is
	performed).  If codec is absent, it is assumed to be
	"null".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A file header is thus described by the following schema:</p>
      <source>
{"type": "record", "name": "org.apache.avro.file.Header",
 "fields" : [
   {"name": "magic", "type": {"type": "fixed", "name": "Magic", "size": 4}},
   {"name": "meta", "type": {"type": "map", "values": "bytes"}},
   {"name": "sync", "type": {"type": "fixed", "name": "Sync", "size": 16}},
  ]
}
      </source>

      <p>A file data block consists of:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A long indicating the count of objects in this block.</li>
	<li>The serialized objects.  If a codec is specified, this is
	compressed by that codec.</li>
	<li>The file's 16-byte sync marker.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Protocol Declaration</title>
      <p>Avro protocols describe RPC interfaces.  Like schemas, they are
      defined with JSON text.</p>

      <p>A protocol is a JSON object with the following attributes:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><em>name</em>, string, to distinguish it from other protocols;</li>
	<li><em>namespace</em>, a string that qualifies the name;</li>
	<li><em>doc</em>, an optional string, describing this protocol;</li>
	<li><em>types</em>, a list of record, enum and error
	  definitions.  An error definition is just like a record
	  definition except it uses "error" instead of "record".  Note
	  that forward references to records, enums and errors are not
	  currently supported.</li>
	<li><em>messages</em>, a JSON object whose keys are message
	  names and whose values are objects whose attributes are
	  described below.  No two messages may have the same name.</li>
      </ul>

      <section>
	<title>Messages</title>
	<p>A message has attributes:</p>
	<ul>
          <li>a <em>doc</em>, an optional description of the message,</li>
	  <li>a <em>request</em>, a list of named,
	    typed <em>parameter</em> schemas (this has the same form
	    as the fields of a record declaration);</li>
	  <li>a <em>response</em> schema; and</li> 
	  <li>an optional union of <em>error</em> schemas.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A request parameter list is processed equivalently to an
	  anonymous record.  Since record field lists may vary between
	  reader and writer, request parameters may also differ
	  between the caller and responder, and such differences are
	  resolved in the same manner as record field differences.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Sample Protocol</title>
	<p>For example, one may define a simple HelloWorld protocol with:</p>
	<source>
{
  "namespace": "com.acme",
  "protocol": "HelloWorld",
  "doc": "Protocol Greetings",

  "types": [
    {"name": "Greeting", "type": "record", "fields": [
      {"name": "message", "type": "string"}]},
    {"name": "Curse", "type": "error", "fields": [
      {"name": "message", "type": "string"}]}
  ],

  "messages": {
    "hello": {
      "doc": "Say hello.",
      "request": [{"name": "greeting", "type": "Greeting" }],
      "response": "Greeting",
      "errors": ["Curse"]
    }
  }

      <title>Protocol Wire Format</title>

      <section>
	<title>Message Transport</title>
	<p>Messages may be transmitted via
	different <em>transport</em> mechanisms.  For example, one
	might use the HTTP, raw sockets, or SSL, etc.  This document
	specifies formats for request and response message data, but
	it does not yet specify any details of how message data is
	encapsulated in different transports.</p>

	<p>To the transport, a <em>message</em> is an opaque byte sequence.</p>

	<p>A transport is a system that supports:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>transmission of request messages</strong>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>receipt of corresponding response messages</strong>
	    <p>Servers will send a response message back to the client
	    corresponding to each request message.  The mechanism of
	    that correspondance is transport-specific.  For example,
	    in HTTP it might be implicit, since HTTP directly supports
	    requests and responses.  But a transport that multiplexes
	    many client threads over a single socket would need to tag
	    messages with unique identifiers.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Message Framing</title>
	<p>Avro messages are <em>framed</em> as a list of buffers.</p>
	<p>Framing is a layer between messages and the transport.
	It exists to optimize certain operations.</p>

	<p>The format of framed message data is:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>a series of <em>buffers</em>, where each buffer consists of:
	    <ul>
	      <li>a four-byte, big-endian <em>buffer length</em>, followed by</li>
	      <li>that many bytes of <em>buffer data</em>.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>A message is always terminated by a zero-lenghted buffer.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Framing is transparent to request and response message
	formats (described below).  Any message may be presented as a
	single or multiple buffers.</p>

	<p>Framing can permit readers to more efficiently get
	different buffers from different sources and for writers to
	more efficiently store different buffers to different
	destinations.  In particular, it can reduce the number of
	times large binary objects are copied.  For example, if an RPC
	parameter consists of a megabyte of file data, that data can
	be copied directly to a socket from a file descriptor, and, on
	the other end, it could be written directly to a file
	descriptor, never entering user space.</p>

	<p>A simple, recommended, framing policy is for writers to
	create a new segment whenever a single binary object is
	written that is larger than a normal output buffer.  Small
	objects are then appended in buffers, while larger objects are
	written as their own buffers.  When a reader then tries to
	read a large object the runtime can hand it an entire buffer
	directly, without having to copy it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Handshake</title>

	<p>RPC requests and responses are prefixed by handshakes.  The
	purpose of the handshake is to ensure that the client and the
	server have each other's protocol definition, so that the
	client can correctly deserialize responses, and the server can
	correctly deserialize requests.  Both clients and servers
	should maintain a cache of recently seen protocols, so that,
	in most cases, a handshake will be completed without extra
	round-trip network exchanges or the transmission of full
	protocol text.</p>

	<p>The handshake process uses the following record schemas:</p>

	<source>
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "HandshakeRequest", "namespace":"org.apache.avro.ipc",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "clientHash",
     "type": {"type": "fixed", "name": "MD5", "size": 16}},
    {"name": "clientProtocol", "type": ["null", "string"]},
    {"name": "serverHash", "type": "MD5"},
    {"name": "meta", "type": ["null", {"type": "map", "values": "bytes"}]}
  ]
}
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "HandshakeResponse", "namespace": "org.apache.avro.ipc",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "match",
     "type": {"type": "enum", "name": "HandshakeMatch",
	      "symbols": ["BOTH", "CLIENT", "NONE"]}},
    {"name": "serverProtocol",
     "type": ["null", "string"]},
    {"name": "serverHash",
     "type": ["null", {"type": "fixed", "name": "MD5", "size": 16}]},
    {"name": "meta",
     "type": ["null", {"type": "map", "values": "bytes"}]}
  ]
}
	</source>

        <ul>
	  <li>A client first prefixes each request with
	  a <code>HandshakeRequest</code> containing just the hash of
	  its protocol and of the server's protocol
	  (<code>clientHash!=null, clientProtocol=null,
	  serverHash!=null</code>), where the hashes are 128-bit MD5
	  hashes of the JSON protocol text. If a client has never
	  connected to a given server, it sends its hash as a guess of
	  the server's hash, otherwise it sends the hash that it
	  previously obtained from this server.</li>

	  <li>The server responds with
	  a <code>HandshakeResponse</code> containing one of:
	    <ul>
	      <li><code>match=BOTH, serverProtocol=null,
	      serverHash=null</code> if the client sent the valid hash
	      of the server's protocol and the server knows what
	      protocol corresponds to the client's hash. In this case,
	      the request is complete and the response data
	      immediately follows the HandshakeResponse.</li>

	      <li><code>match=CLIENT, serverProtocol!=null,
	      serverHash!=null</code> if the server has previously
	      seen the client's protocol, but the client sent an
	      incorrect hash of the server's protocol. The request is
	      complete and the response data immediately follows the
	      HandshakeResponse. The client must use the returned
	      protocol to process the response and should also cache
	      that protocol and its hash for future interactions with
	      this server.</li>

              <li><code>match=NONE, serverProtocol!=null,
	      serverHash!=null</code> if the server has not previously
	      seen the client's protocol and the client sent an
	      incorrect hash of the server's protocol.

	      <p>In this case The client must then re-submit its
	      request with its protocol text (<code>clientHash!=null,
	      clientProtocol!=null, serverHash!=null</code>) and the
	      server should respond with with a successful match
	      (<code>match=BOTH, serverProtocol=null,
	      serverHash=null</code>) as above.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>The <code>meta</code> field is reserved for future
	handshake enhancements.</p>

      <section>
	<title>Call Format</title>
	<p>A <em>call</em> consists of a request message paired with
	its resulting response or error message.  Requests and
	responses contain extensible metadata, and both kinds of
	messages are framed as described above.</p>

	<p>The format of a call request is:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><em>request metadata</em>, a map with values of
	  type <code>bytes</code></li>
	  <li>the <em>message name</em>, an Avro string,
	  followed by</li>
	  <li>the message <em>parameters</em>.  Parameters are
	  serialized according to the message's request
	  declaration.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The format of a call response is:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><em>response metadata</em>, a map with values of
	  type <code>bytes</code></li>
	  <li>a one-byte <em>error flag</em> boolean, followed by either:
	    <ul>
	      <li>if the error flag is false, the message <em>response</em>,
		serialized per the message's response schema.</li>
	      <li>if the error flag is true, the <em>error</em>,
	      serialized per the message's error union schema.</li>
	    </ul>

    <section>
      <title>Schema Resolution</title>

      <p>A reader of Avro data, whether from an RPC or a file, can
	always parse that data because its schema is provided.  But
	that schema may not be exactly the schema that was expected.
	For example, if the data was written with a different version
	of the software than it is read, then records may have had
	fields added or removed.  This section specifies how such
	schema differences should be resolved.</p>

      <p>We call the schema used to write the data as
	the <em>writer's</em> schema, and the schema that the
	application expects the <em>reader's</em> schema.  Differences
	between these should be resolved as follows:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><p>It is an error if the two schemas do not <em>match</em>.</p>
	  <p>To match, one of the following must hold:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>both schemas are arrays whose item types match</li>
	    <li>both schemas are maps whose value types match</li>
	    <li>both schemas are enums whose names match</li>
	    <li>both schemas are fixed whose sizes and names match</li>
	    <li>both schemas are records with the same name</li>
	    <li>either schema is a union</li>
	    <li>both schemas have same primitive type</li>
	    <li>the writer's schema may be <em>promoted</em> to the
	      reader's as follows:
	      <ul>
		<li>int is promotable to long, float, or double</li>
		<li>long is promotable to float or double</li>
		<li>float is promotable to double</li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>if both are records:</strong>
	  <ul>
	    <li>the ordering of fields may be different: fields are
              matched by name.</li>
	    
	    <li>schemas for fields with the same name in both records
	      are resolved recursively.</li>
	    
	    <li>if the writer's record contains a field with a name
	      not present in the reader's record, the writer's value
	      for that field is ignored.</li>
	    
	    <li>if the reader's record schema has a field that
              contains a default value, and writer's schema does not
              have a field with the same name, then the reader should
              use the default value from its field.</li>

	    <li>if the reader's record schema has a field with no
              default value, and writer's schema does not have a field
              with the same name, then the field's value is
              unset.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>if both are enums:</strong>
	  <p>if the writer's symbol is not present in the reader's
	    enum, then the enum's value is unset.</p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>if both are arrays:</strong>
	  <p>This resolution algorithm is applied recursively to the reader's and
	    writer's array item schemas.</p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>if both are maps:</strong>
	  <p>This resolution algorithm is applied recursively to the reader's and
	    writer's value schemas.</p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>if both are unions:</strong>
	  <p>The first schema in the reader's union that matches the
	    selected writer's union schema is recursively resolved
	    against it.  if none match, an error is signalled.</p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>if reader's is a union, but writer's is not</strong>
	  <p>The first schema in the reader's union that matches the
	    writer's schema is recursively resolved against it.  If none
	    match, an error is signalled.</p>
	</li>
	  
	<li><strong>if writer's is a union, but reader's is not</strong>
	  <p>If the reader's schema matches the selected writer's schema,
	    it is recursively resolved against it.  If they do not
	    match, an error is signalled.</p>
	</li>
	  
      </ul>

      <p>A schema's "doc" fields are ignored for the purposes of schema resolution.  Hence,
        the "doc" portion of a schema may be dropped at serialization.</p>
