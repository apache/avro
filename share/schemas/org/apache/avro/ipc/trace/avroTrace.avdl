/**
 * A Span is our basic unit of tracing. It tracks the critical points
 * of a single RPC call and records other call meta-data. It also
 * allows arbitrary string annotations. Both the client and server create
 * Span objects, each of which is populated with half of the relevant event
 * data. They share a span ID, which allows us to merge them into one complete
 * span later on.
